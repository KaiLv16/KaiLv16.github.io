I'm Kai Lv, a 4th year Ph.D. student at <a href='http://www.ict.ac.cn/'>Institute of computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</a>(ICT, CAS), advised by <a href='https://cnic.cas.cn/rcdw/yjy/202309/t20230919_6890324.html'>Prof. Gaogang Xie</a> and <a href='https://panheng.github.io/'>Prof. Heng Pan</a>.
I received my B.E. degree in Electronic Engineering from <a href='https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University</a>, China, in 2020.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
